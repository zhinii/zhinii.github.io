Sparse Interior will reduce cost and print. Solid Interior will result in a more durable part.

Sparse will reduce print time and cost, but often results in failed prints and is recommended only for advanced users. Basic is similar to sparse. Recommended only for advanced users. SMART is the recommended setting, will calculate where more support is needed and use less support where it is not needed. Surround will completely surround the model with support material. This will increase print cost and time, but will ensure the highest probability of a successful build. Recommended for use with models that have highly intricate/delicate features.

Specify the amount of copies of the part to be printed. The size of the number of copies cannot exceed the build volume.

It is important to select the units the .stl file was modeled in. If the file appears extremely small, select inches. If the file is extremely large, select mm.
