<br>Homage to the Square: Against Deep Blue</p>

<p>I found this image provocative in contrast to the other pieces on the harvard website due to it's simplicity.
<br>
The simplicity is done in a number of ways, the minimal color palette and the roughness of the strokes.
<br>
This simplicity seemed appropriate to match my minimal crude p5 skills.
<br>I decided to mimic the simple color palette, using only 4 colors. I also decided to utilize basic shapes, square and a circle.
<br>I also implemented very basic p5 functions that when mashed together can create a very busy and chaotic composition.
<br> Writing the code was iteresting and an exploration. The most difficult part of the exercise was trying to think of what to express.
<br> Meeting the check list of requirements had me stuck, for example, on the for loop. Trying to decide where i want to implement one.
<br> The references on the p5 website seemed adequate enough to explain how to execute all the requirements of the assignment.
