     *          NOTE - READ THIS ENTIRE FILE BEFORE YOU START DOING ANYTHING
     *            MUCH OF WHAT IS DESCRIBED HERE IS ALREADY DONE FOR YOU!
     *
     *          THE GOAL IS TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND AND RECOGNIZE THE
     *            STRUCTURE AND DESIGN OF JQUERY PLUGINS, AS WELL AS TO
     *            HELP YOU UNDERSTAND JWPLAYER AND VIDEO APPLICATION APIs
     *
     *  Our jQuery Collections plugin, 'playerConnect', acts on a collection
     *  of HTML elements that represent the transcript to be the selection
     *  passed by jQuery. It also expects one argument - the jwplayer object
     *  that represents the player that's been initialized in the page.
     *
     *  Each HTML element must have
     *  two attributes: data-start and data-dur. These are numbers (floats)
     *  which reflect the matching time range (in seconds) from the
     *  video.
     *
     *  HTML Example:
     *  <span class="words" data-start="17.869" data-dur="3.82">Hey this is
          Dwayne Johnson. While playing astronaut Chuck Baker in the film Planet</span>
        <span class="words" data-start="21.689" data-dur="0.701">51</span>
        <span class="words" data-start="22.39" data-dur="3.56">I gained a lot of
          respect for our nation's space program. NASA makes new</span>
     *
     *  This plugin will do two things.
     *
     *      1) It will attach an onTime handler
                 (http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1413089-javascript-api-reference#seek)
     *         to the player which
     *         iterates over the selected transcript elements, and
     *         applies the 'hilite' class if the time position of the player
     *         is within the time range defined by the data-start and
     *         data-dur attributes of the element. Accordingly, if the
     *         element is not in the specified range, we remove any
     *         'hilite' class.
     *
     *      2) It will attach a click hander to each transcript element
     *         which gets that element's start time from data-start and
     *         calls player.seek() with that time as its argument.
     *
     *     The result is that as the video plays, the part of the transcript
     *     that's being spoken will highlight, and a user clicking on any
     *     transcript text will cause the video to play the relevant segment.
     *
     *

        // Here we define our function that will run every time the player
        //  updates its "position" property. 'onTime' is an event that is triggered

        //  per second while the video is playing.

                /*  Next you need to iterate over the transcriptElements (using a 'for' loop or
                 *   transcriptElements.each()), and for each one, see if the 'time' is greater
                 *   than the element's data-start and less than the end
                 *   ('end' being equal to data-start plus data-dur).  The jquery .attr() function
                 *   will be useful here.
                 *
                 *  If the player time is in range use jQuery's addClass() to add the "hilite" class
                 *   to the element. Otherwise, use removeClass() to remove it. ".hilite" is already defined
                 *   in the stylesheet, so you don't have to manipulate the element styles themselves.
                 *
                 *  Remember that the attribute values are going to come to you as Strings
                 *   and you'll need to change them into Floats or Integers (parseFloat(), parseInt()).
                 *   Don't worry about non-numeric data or missing attributes - it's OK to assume that
                 *   the data in the HTML is valid.
                 *
                 *   in pseudo-code it's something like this:
                 *      for each transcript element
                 *          if (time >= element_start_time && time <=element_end_time)
                 *             add "hilight" class
                 *          else
                 *             remove "hilite" class
                 *
                 *   Note that the 'transcriptElements' array variable is already defined (line 43) and
                 *   contains the array of <SPAN> elements. You just have to iterate and do the rest
