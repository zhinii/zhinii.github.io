  <br>set up a three.js scene. Created basic geometries and can position them.
  <br>Also have implemented controller so you can use the mouse to navigate the scene.
  <br>TO DO:
  <li>explore raycasting for picking objects</li>
  <li>explore shading and basic rendering</li>
  <li>explore click events in a scene to open other hidden objects or starting a basic animation</li>
  <li>explore using custom geometries and not basic obejcts</li>
  
  <p>4/7/16</p>
  <br>menus working. showing hiding divs working. layers all displaying properly.
  <br>having issues with resizing windows and elements displaying properly. decided to make window size fixed and not worry about resizing.
  <br> moving onto three.js and making 3d model interactive. 
  
  <p>3/31/16</p>
  <br>My goal today is to get divs to each open their own background. running into issues of the image not displaying.

  Tried mashing all the individual pieces together onto the same page
  <br><a href="http://zhinii.github.io/prototype/menu2.html">http://zhinii.github.io/prototype/menu2.html</a>
  <br> doing the collapse button, hides the menu and doesn't allow it to reappear. 
  <br> but using the collapse only code <a href="http://zhinii.github.io/prototype/menu.html">http://zhinii.github.io/prototype/menu.html</a>
  <br> the menu collapses and expands just fine. why does it do this? i don't know.

  <p>three.js example https://github.com/zhinii/three.js-first-run.git</p>
  <p>interesting things from this example, no CSS, all JS scripting is in the body of the html. The .js file is copied directly, with a cube as the object
  <br> Dissecting the .js to understand how the geometry is created. Not sure if it is from an .obj or .stl or defined manually.
