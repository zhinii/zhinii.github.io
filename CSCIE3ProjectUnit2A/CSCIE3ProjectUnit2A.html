      <h1>CSCI E-3 Unit 2 Project: Part A</h1>
      <p class="whatlearn">This is worth half of the total point value for the
        Unit 2 Project. This is worth half of the total point value for the Unit 2 Project.
        There will be a Unit 2 Project: Part B as well, released in two weeks. The course material
        needed to solve these problems is covered in weeks 1-4 of the course. Some of these solutions
        will require that you use concepts you've learned in new ways, or look up and use new properties
        and methods of standard Javascript objects, such as String or Math. If the conceptual
        leap from the basics you've learned so far to the problems here seems large, be sure
        to attend section meetings, ask questions in Piazza, and re-read/re-watch
        the course material if necessary! </p>
      <h3 class="whatlearn">What you're learning:</h3>
      <p>How to handle the most basic information in a computer program: numbers
        and strings, arrays, and conditionals.<br>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Math: Basic mathematical calculations underlie nearly everything
          that you'll do with a computer program: counting photos to layout on
          a page, calculating prices in a shopping cart, positioning a ball on a
          game screen, or figuring the length of the bar on a graph. <br>
        </li>
        <li>String Handling: manipulating text</li>
        <li>Arrays</li>
        <li>Conditionals, looping, and functions are some of the most basic
          structures in computer programming. These also underlie just about
          everything you'll do in a program.&nbsp; </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>What you need to do:</h3>
      <ol>
        <ol>
          <li>Follow the example to create your own mathematical converter (5 points)</li>
          <li>Place an X in an automatically-chosen random location within a box
            (5 points)</li>
          <li>Use indexOf() and substr() or slice() to divide your name into two
            strings&mdash;firstname and lastname (10 points)</li>
          <li>Provide a feature in this page that counts the words input into
            the input box below (15 points)</li>
          <li>Write a function that will calculate the sum of the first 12 even
            Fibonacci numbers (20 points)</li>
          <li>Image processing (array handling)&mdash;(20 points)</li>
        </ol>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <h4>1) Create a mathematical converter for temperature</h4>
      <p>In the zip file you downloaded for this project, open js/hw2ConvertTemp.js. It contains a function called <span style="font-family: monospace;">convertFtoC()</span>
        and one called <span style="font-family: monospace;">convertCtoF()</span>,
        which, at the moment, do nothing. You're going to edit this file to provide the code that
        makes these functions work to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius, and vice
        versa.&nbsp; You can test your code with the form fields below&mdash;your
        conversion code will run whenever you change the content of the input
        fields.</p>
      <p>If the user types in values that are not numbers, do nothing.</p>
      <p>Remember that the formula for converting temperature looks like this:</p>
      <span style="font-family: monospace;">°C x 9/5 + 32 = °F<br>
        <br>
        (°F - 32) x 5/9 = °C</span><br>
      <br>
      &nbsp; <input size="3" id="degC">°C is equal to <span class="degOutput"
        id="degFOut"></span>°F
      <br>&nbsp; <input size="3" id="degF">°F is equal to <span class="degOutput"
        id="degCOut"></span>°C
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <h4>2) Place an X in an automatically-chosen random location within a box</h4>
      <p>This is an exercise in using Javascript's random number generator,
        along with some simple arithmetic, to place an X in a box in a randomly
        chosen location. Applications of this would include placing a game
        character on the game board, or setting stars or snowflakes in a
        graphic.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, your task is to calculate a random x and y coordinate for
        the location of the 'X'.&nbsp; You'll have to do some math to get the
        random number, generated by a function which returns a floating-point
        number between 0 and 1, to map to the width and height of the containing DIV.
        js/hw2PutAnX.js contains an empty function where you will add your code.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <div id="putAnX">
        <div id="theX">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
      <div id="putAnXButton" class="hwbutton">Place the X!</div>
      &nbsp;
      <h4>3. Use indexOf() and substr() or substring() to divide your name into
        two strings&mdash;firstname and lastname</h4>
      <p>We're going to use some basic built-in string functions to manipulate a
        string: your name. Modify the code in the js/hw2SplitString.js file to
        output the first and last name separately into the page below.  Your code should
        work for any name entered. See the JS file for more on what input validation
        is expected.
      </p>
      <p><input size="30" id="fullName"> is my full name. </p>
      <div id="splitName" class="hwbutton">Split my name!</div>
      <br>
      <span class="" id="firstname"></span> is my first name<br>
      <span class="" id="lastname"></span> is my last name<br>
      <h4>4. Write a function that will calculate the sum of the first 12 even
        Fibonacci numbers</h4>
      <p>Recall that the Fibonacci sequence is a series that begins with two
        integers: 0, 1. The next number in the sequence is derived by adding the
        previous two numbers, so the Fibonacci sequence looks like this: 0, 1,
        1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The button below will run your function, called twelveEvenFibonacciSum()
        and print its result in the space provided. All you have to do is write
        the function, which accepts no arguments, and returns the sum of the
        first 12 even Fibonacci numbers. Your code will go in
        js/hw2TwelveEvenFib.js&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Hint: First you'll need a loop that generates Fibonacci numbers. You'll
        need a way to test each one for whether it's even or odd. And you'll
        need to sum up the even ones, counting them as you go.  Count zero as the
        first even number in the sequence.  </p>
      <div id="sumFib" class="hwbutton">Get the Sum!</div>
      <br>
      The sum of the first 12 even Fibonacci numbers is: <span class="" id="sumFibResult"></span>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4>5. Provide a feature in this page that counts the words input into the
        input box below</h4>
      The box below accepts text input from the keyboard or copy/paste.&nbsp;
      Your job is to add a feature to this page that provides an approximate
      word count for the user who's typing into the page.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      To do this successfully, you'll need to:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Create your own Javascript file in the js directory of this project.
          Call it whatever you want. </li>
        <li>&nbsp;Add a <span style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;script&gt;</span>
          tag to the page at the bottom that loads your new js file.</li>
        <li>In your JS file:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Use document.getElementById() to get the textarea element from the
            page. You'll need its ID, which you can find in the HTML of this
            page.</li>
          <li>Write an event handler function that runs every time someone types
            in the textarea. It will look something like this:<br>
            <span style="font-family: monospace;">myTextareaElement.onkeyup =
              function(){<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // your code goes here<br>
              }<br>
            </span></li>
          <li>You'll want to access the .value property of the textarea to get
            the contents of the box as a String</li>
          <li>Use <span style=" font-family: monospace;">String.split()</span>
            to divide the string (at word boundaries) into an array of Strings<span
              style=" font-family: monospace;"></span></li>
          <li>Count the elements in the array. This will be (roughly) the number
            of words in the box</li>
          <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">Write that value</span> into
            the HTML element that looks like this: <span style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;span
              id="wordcount"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</span></li>
        </ul>
        <li>You may notice that
          this solution as outlined above will not count words correctly if
          there are extra 'whitespace' characters in your text.&nbsp;
          For this assignment, that's OK.
          However, if you like, for extra credit (10 points) design your solution so that
          extra consecutive whitespaces are not counted. </li>
        <ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p><textarea id="myWordsToCount" rows="5" cols="60"></textarea><br>
      </p>
      The wordcount is: <span id="wordcount"></span><br>
      <h4>6. Image processing (array handling) </h4>
      <p>The image below (labeled "Original") appears inside an HTML canvas element.&nbsp; We'll
        learn more about canvas elements later in the course. For now, the
        important thing to know is that, unlike an image displayed normally in
        the browser using the IMG tag, the image data that appears in a canvas
        element is available to Javascript as a "bitmap". </p>
      <p>The bitmap data is an Array that maps four numbers to each pixel in the
        image: r, g, b, a, where r, g, b are integer values from 0 to 255 which
        describe red, green, and blue respectively; and a, which is an 'alpha'
        value between 0 and 255 in which 0 is transparent and 255 is completely
        opaque. Since there are four array elements for each pixel, the total
        array will contain 4 times as many elements as there are pixels in the image. </p>
      <p>The first pixel's red data is at data[0], the second pixel's red data
        at data[4], etc. </p>
      <p>Your job is to write additional code inside the function that will
        modify the image data to create four new versions, as described below
        and in the <span style="font-family: monospace;">js/hw2ArrayImageProcessing.js</span>
        file.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Remember, this problem is, at its essence, about arrays and looping and counting, not about fancy graphics-processing mathematics.  The key is to
      traverse the data array, copying and modifying the appropriate values as you go.  Along the way, you'll be learning that looping
      and counting can sometimes be all it takes to do "fancy graphics-processing mathematics"! </p>
      <p>Here's a diagram that may help.  This is a nine-pixel approximation of the French flag, as a bitmap.
      There are nine pixels, each with four array elements to describe their appearance, for 36 data elements in all.
      So, for example, to change the color of the top-right pixel to blue, you'd change
      <span style="font-family: monospace;">imgArr[8]</span> to zero and <span style="font-family: monospace;">imgArr[10]</span> to 255. 
<br><img src="img/french-flag-bitmap.png" style="width: 700px"></p>
      <p>In this case, you won't actually change the values in the original image array itself, but rather you'll copy
      the values over to a new array, and make the changes there.  The comments in the js/hw2ArrayImageProcessing.js file should point you in
      the right direction. </p>
      
      
      <p><strong>Important Note: To do this exercise using your local file
          system (with no Web server involved), <u>you will need to use Firefox as
          your browser.</u> Chrome will display an error due to security
          constraints.</strong> </p>
      <table style="width: 100%" border="1">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Original</td>
            <td>BLUE-only version</td>
            <td>Reverse-color version</td>
            <td>semi-transparent version</td>
            <td>add two images version</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><canvas id="originalCanvas"></canvas><br>
            </td>
            <td><canvas id="blueCanvas"></canvas><br>

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <p>If you've done this correctly, the table above will look something like this screengrab:
